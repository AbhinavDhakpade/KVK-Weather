"""
Management command: recompute_gdd

Repairs the running cumulative GDD (growing degree days) of stored weather.

Older versions of the weather sync added the same days to the total again on
every run, so gdd_cumulative kept growing. This walks each farm's stored days
in date order and rebuilds the running total from the daily GDD values:

  - Real readings (NASA POWER / Open-Meteo) are re-chained: each day's total is
    the previous day's total plus that day's gdd_daily, starting from 0 at the
    first stored real reading.
  - Demo "seed" rows are left exactly as they are, and real readings after them
    continue from the seed total.
  - Forecast rows continue on from the last observed day.

Usage:
    python manage.py recompute_gdd --dry-run     # show what would change
    python manage.py recompute_gdd               # repair every farm
    python manage.py recompute_gdd --farm 2      # one farm only
